Judgment 
 
 
Accused being an employer is charged under Sections 5(1) & 85(1)(a) and 94(1) (i) 
(vi) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act – Act No.28 of 2005 coupled with 
Section 44(2) of the Interpretation and General Clauses Act with unlawfully: 
1. failing on or about the 24th day of May 2018 to ensure so far as is reasonably 
practicable, the safety and health at work of one of its employees namely one 
Beebee Sahidah Sumtally who sustained chemical injury to her right eye 
while she was manually spreading cement powder in the furrows of the 
sugarcane field at Trois Ilots, Olivia.    
2. failing on or about the 25th day of May 2018 to forthwith notify the Director, 
Occupational Safety and Health by the quickest practicable means of an 
accident arising out of work which occurred in the sugarcane field at Trois 
Ilots, Olivia on 24th May 2018 and as a result of which accident one of its 
 
2
employees, namely one Beebee Sahidah Sumtally sustained chemical injury 
to her right eye which necessitated her admission to hospital for more than 24 
hours.  
The particulars of the charges provided by the Prosecution upon request of 
the Defence are given verbatim below: 
1. Beebee Sahida Sumtally, field worker was manually spreading cement 
powder (Lafarge Cement) in the furrows of Trois Ilots Sugarcane field when 
the cement powder blew into the right eye of Mrs. Beebee Sahida Sumtally. 
2. According to her medical certificate, Mrs. Beebee Sahida Sumtally sustained 
chemical injury to her right eye. 
3. According to the Material Safety Data Sheet of (Lafarge Cement), safety 
goggles should be used to protect the eyes during the use of cement powder. 
4. No safety goggles were provided to Mrs. Beebee Sahida Sumtally by the 
employer at time of accident. 
5. After the accident, safety goggles were provided to field workers involved in 
the spreading of cement powder. 
6. The employer failed to forthwith notify the accident by the quickest practicable 
means to the Director, Occupational Safety and Health.  
The Accused through its representative, Mr. Arvind Sooknauth in his capacity as 
Safety and Health Officer, has pleaded not guilty to both counts and has retained the 
services of Counsel at its trial. 
 
The case for the Prosecution rested solely on the evidence given by Mrs. Tina 
Ramsurrun-Baznauth in her capacity as Occupational Safety and Health Officer while 
no evidence was adduced on behalf of the Defence.  
 
Mrs. Tina Ramsurrun-Baznauth in her capacity as Occupational Safety and 
Health Officer enquired into an accident at work which occurred on 24.5.2018 at a 
sugarcane field situated at Trois Ilots, Olivia whereby Mrs. Beebee Sahidah Sumtally 
sustained chemical injury to her right eye as per the medical certificate produced 
namely Doc. A.   The latter reveals that she was admitted to hospital on 24.5.2018 
 
3
and was discharged on 26.5.2018 on the ground that she was suffering from 
“Chemical Injury Right Eye”. 
 
Her enquiry revealed that on the material day, Accused’s employee namely Mrs. 
Sumtally was manually spreading cement powder in the furrows of the sugarcane 
field at Trois Ilots, Olivia when the cement powder got into contact with her right eye.  
The accident happened on 24.5.2018 and it was notified to the Director Occupational 
Safety and Health on 30.5.2018.  The cement that was being used originated from 
“Lafarge Ciments” société. 
 
As per the usual practice, employees were required to tie a piece of cloth around 
their waists and to fill the cloth with cement powder and to spread the cement powder 
along in the furrows.  The enquiry has revealed that it was after the accident meaning 
after the cement powder or cement dusts had got into contact with her right eye, that 
she used a piece of cloth which she had tied around her forehead to wipe her eyes. 
 
In the course of her enquiry, she took two photographs of the locus of the 
accident on 7.6.2018 namely about two weeks after the accident as per Docs.B1 and 
B2.  The first photograph (Doc. B1) showed the sugarcane field and the furrows 
where Mrs. Sumtally was spreading cement powder at the time of accident.  The 
second one (Doc. B2) showed the same sugarcane field with an empty cement bag.  
 
She received a copy of the report of Mr. Arvind Sooknauth in his capacity as 
safety and health officer namely an Accident Investigation report.  She also received 
the material safety data sheet for cement (hereinafter referred to as “MSDS”) and the 
risk assessment from the accused employer (all three collectively as per Doc. C).  
There was no work activity that was carried out at the time of her investigation and 
empty bags of cement from “Lafarge Ciments” société were observed in the field.  On 
5.10.2020, she recorded a Defence statement under warning from Mr. Arvind 
Sooknauth, the representative of accused company, as per Doc. D wherein he 
denied liability in relation to both counts.   However, Mr. Arvind Sooknauth, did not 
depone as to the truth of his statement in Court nor as to the truth of his Accident 
Investigation report (Docs. D&C) inasmuch as no evidence was adduced by the 
Defence after the close of the Prosecution case. 
 
 After her enquiry, she drew up a report in October 2020 which she did not 
produce as she was not an expert.  According to her, the chemical injury sustained 
 
4
by Mrs. Sumtally meant that the chemical was cement powder or cement dusts 
although no such mention was made in the medical certificate which wrote “Chemical 
Injury Right Eye” (see- Doc. A.).   
 
According to the MSDS for cement provided by “Lafarge Ciments” société and 
submitted by the accused employer to the Ministry, the personal protective 
equipment hereinafter referred to as “P.P.E.” that should have been provided while 
using cement, were safety goggles.  At the time of accident, Mrs. Sumtally was not 
provided with safety goggles but only with safety gloves, rubber boots and a 
disposable mask.  It was only after the accident that safety goggles were provided.     
 
The accident occurred at about 10.15 hours and Mrs. Sumtally although being 
issued with a memo, continued to work and then went home afterwards.  It was only 
in the afternoon of the material day which was a Thursday that she went to the 
Dispensary of Bel Air and then she was admitted to Moka Hospital. The enquiring 
officer admitted that she could not say what the injured person might have done or 
what she could have put into her injured eye to heal or cure as to what happened.  
  
But her enquiry revealed that cement powder which is a chemical went into the 
eye of that worker during working hours and the said accident was reported 
immediately to Mrs. Sumtally’s Supervisor.  The notification was made by the 
accused employer and which was submitted 6 days after the accident and it 
mentioned that the cause of the accident to be the contact with cement dust.  
Investigation was carried out after the notification and it was found that actually 
cement dust got into contact with the right eye of that worker.  The injury referred to 
in the medical certificate was one of the injuries to be notified immediately/forthwith to 
the Director, Occupational Safety and Health.  Such notification did not require to be 
done after 24 hours as it falls under the 11th schedule.  Mrs. Sumtally was 
discharged from hospital on a Saturday and the time of discharge was not specified 
and she resumed work on the Monday.  It was thus, only as from that day, Monday, 
that the accused company was made aware of the exact reason of the admission of 
that worker and within 2 days, that is, on Wednesday, the Accused notified the 
Ministry.   
 
She could not say whether the circumstances of the accident as revealed by her 
were different from that of the Accused as per its Defence statement (Doc. D).  But 
she did not agree that according to the internal enquiry of Accused, the cement 
 
5
powder or cement dusts got into her right eye when she cleaned or rubbed her face 
with the piece of cloth tied around her forehead and in that respect wearing goggles 
or not would have made no difference.  The reason being that the enquiry revealed 
that it was only after the cement powder which she was spreading went into her eye, 
only after that, she cleaned her face with the piece of cloth tied around her forehead.  
Besides, according to her, had Mrs. Sumtally been wearing safety goggles, even if 
she wiped her face with her mask on, no cement powder would have gone into her 
eye.  She again maintained that if she was provided with safety goggles, cement 
powder would not have got into her eye.   
 
The Defence did not adduce any evidence in Court. 
 
I have given due consideration to all the evidence put forward before me and the 
submissions of learned Counsel for the Defence.  
 
First and foremost, no witness for the Prosecution confirmed the version of the 
enquiring officer namely Mrs. T. Ramsurrun-Baznauth in Court and her conclusion as 
to the cause of the accident namely the victim not wearing goggles and the remedial 
action to be taken like goggles to be provided to the workers cannot be relied upon, 
as she is not an expert inasmuch as her report following completion of her enquiry, 
was not produced in Court  upon objection taken on that ground by learned Counsel 
for the Defence.  
 
She did not witness the accident and when she went to the locus about two 
weeks after the accident took place, she did not witness how the work was being 
done, but she only saw the furrows and empty bags as per the photographs taken by 
her.  She did not adduce any evidence as regards the system of work put into place 
by the accused employer commensurate with the ongoing in- house trainings given 
to employees following the risk assessment done prior to the accident, so that it can 
be inferred that at the material time, the system of work of Accused was unsafe.  In 
the same breath, at no time she stated in Court that the risk assessment was not a 
sufficient and suitable one because the risks to injury were not identified for the 
activity that was being carried out by the injured person at the time of accident viz. 
spreading cement powder manually in the furrows of the sugarcane field.  
 
More importantly, she did not explain the circumstances of the accident namely 
how the cement powder got into the right eye of the employee.   But she rested 
 
6
content in saying that it was only after the cement powder or cement dusts had 
already got into her eye, that the employee wiped her eyes with the piece of cloth tied 
to her forehead.  
 Therefore, there is no conclusive evidence be it expert evidence or otherwise on 
the basis of which it can be inferred that the system of work of Accused at the 
material time was unsafe and that the chemical injury sustained by the worker at her 
right eye was an operating cause of that unsafe system of work.  
 
At this stage, it is relevant to note that as per a MSDS for cement emanating from 
“Lafarge Ciments” société, while using the cement, as per Doc. C, as far as the 
protection of the eyes are concerned, the following was stated:  
 
“Protection des yeux: 
porter des lunettes de protection en cas de 
risque d’envolées de poussières ou en cas de risque de projection de poudre ou de 
pâte dans les yeux.” 
 
Now as per the risk assessment carried out prior to the accident in 2017 (Doc. C), 
spraying of cement in furrows was done with due consideration to the wind direction.  
Further, in order to avoid back injury due to repetitive bending, cement bags of 25 kg 
were to be used instead of 50 kg.  Further, all field supervisors should have to ensure 
that field workers adopted safe lifting techniques and carried quantities according to 
individual capacity and to have ensured strict supervision in the use of close fittings 
goggles. Besides, all field supervisors should have to ensure implementation of all 
established safe work procedures as per in-house trainings provided.  Moreover, they 
should have to consult the MSDS or labelling on containers of chemicals and 
operating instructions manual of newly purchased machines before using.  Those 
responsible for action were to be Area Managers, Field Supervisors/ Safety and 
Health Officer. 
 
It is of paramount importance to note that the injured person did not depone – (i) 
as to how the accident happened following the ongoing training that she had received 
in conformity with the risk assessment done by the Accused prior to the accident, (ii) 
as to when to use close fittings goggles which required strict supervision (see- Doc. 
C) and (iii) how they were supplied whether on demand by her or were provided to 
her by her Superiors routinely.  
 
 
7
Nor any witness deposed as to the absence of training being dispensed in 
relation to the use of goggles. I shall equally not rely on the Accident Investigation 
report drawn by Mr. A. Sooknauth in line with his out of Court statement as he was 
not called by the Defence to depone as to the truth thereof although he was present 
in Court.  
 
Further, no evidence was adduced on behalf of the Prosecution regarding the 
manner the cement powder was being spread in the furrows by the injured person at 
the material time, whether in a bending or standing position, for example, below the 
waist level(so that it did not become airborne) or above the waist level( so that it 
became airborne), whether by means of a sprayer or only her hands, whether it was 
windy on that day and the wind direction so that it could be inferred that it was 
against the risk assessment.   Such important fact as to how the spreading of cement 
powder in the furrows was done in the sugarcane field by the Accused’s employee at 
the time of the accident was completely omitted by the enquiring officer and who did 
not witness the accident.    
 
Again, no evidence has been led by the enquiring officer that the weather was 
windy on the material day so that it could be inferred that the cement powder became 
airborne warranting the use of goggles as per the MSDS of cement and risk 
assessment.  The testimony of the enquiring officer is silent as to whether the injured 
person had to be supplied with the individual PPEs or they were provided to her on 
demand as per the training dispensed to her, bearing in mind that as per the risk 
assessment (Doc. C) prior to the accident, goggles were to be provided under strict 
supervision.  It is beyond dispute that a piece of cloth tied to her forehead at the 
material time was not a PPE put to her use by the Accused but a straw hat as per the 
risk assessment.  The enquiry did not reveal why the injured person did not use the 
PPE put to her use be it a straw hat or a pair of goggles in accordance with the 
training dispensed to her in conformity with the risk assessment (Doc. C) done prior 
to the accident.    
 
Therefore, there is no conclusive evidence to show that the wearing of goggles 
were called for on the material day, as the enquiry is silent as regards the manner 
and the amount of the cement powder that was being spread in the furrows from the 
cloth containing cement powder tied to the waist of the injured person, the weather 
conditions on that day, so that it can be inferred that the spreading of cement powder 
became airborne and the risk assessment was not complied with.   
 
8
 
According to the enquiring officer, it stands to reason that, the cement powder 
having got into the right eye of the employee did not bother her at all, as she did not 
feel any tingling or highly irritating or painful sensation leading her to wash her said 
eye straight away with water, rather than wiping it with a non-PPE, that is, the cloth 
tied around her forehead.  Furthermore, the enquiry revealed that she could continue 
working by spreading the cement powder again in the furrows and going to her place 
afterwards without any impediment to her right eye which means that the cement 
powder or cement dusts did not bother her at all in the course of her duty and that 
her right eye settled by itself like any ordinary dust getting into ones eye and settles 
afterwards without any treatment needed and as such she did not need treatment, 
given that she did not use the memo given to her to go to the hospital, but chose to 
continue working and to go home as usual.  Moreover, no witness deposed as to the 
state of her eye following the accident bearing in mind that there is nothing to 
suggest that it was the presence of cement powder in her right eye that was the 
operating cause of the injury to that eye save and except the opinion of the enquiring 
officer who is not an expert bearing in mind that the medical certificate makes no 
mention of the presence of cement powder or of cement dusts that caused the 
chemical injury to her right eye as per Doc. A.  Thus, the opinion of the enquiring 
officer again cannot be relied upon inasmuch as she is not an expert.   
 
Therefore, there is no conclusive evidence led by the Prosecution to the effect 
that the system of work adopted by the Accused at the material time was unsafe 
following the risk assessment done by it about one year prior to the material day.  
Further, it is doubtful as to whether there was any injury at all sustained by Mrs. 
Beebee Sahidah Sumtally at the material time or just a mere discomfort to her right 
eye at the workplace of Accused during working hours, so that forthwith notification to 
the relevant authority by the Accused would have been warranted. 
 
For all the reasons given above, I am unable to find that the Prosecution has 
discharged its burden of establishing its case beyond reasonable doubt that the 
system of work adopted by the Accused at the material time was unsafe and that 
there was an actionable accident namely injury to the said employee warranting 
forthwith notification to the relevant authority namely the Director, Occupational 
Safety and Health by the Accused (see - The DPP v Flacq United Estates Ltd 
[2001 SCJ 301]).  On that score, there is no need for the Accused in order to be 
exempted from liability, to establish on a balance of probabilities that it was not 
 
9
reasonably practicable for it to do more than what it has already done (see - Talbot 
Fishing Co Ltd. v Ministry of Labour & Industrial Relations (Occupational 
Safety and Health Inspectorate) [2006 SCJ 76]). 
  
I, accordingly dismiss the information against the Accused in relation to both 
counts.
